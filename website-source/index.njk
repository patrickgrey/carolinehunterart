    <div class="rs-column flow">
        <p>Caroline is well known for her understated, yet powerful, somewhat
mesmerizing seascapes and for her equally arresting still lifes, which have a distinctive,
almost timeless quality. Often juxtaposing vibrant summer flowers and grasses with
shells, seaweed or sea glass, her intimate connection to Scotland's wild places and a
certain contemplative sensibility resonate throughout her work.</p>
